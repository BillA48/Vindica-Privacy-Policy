# Vindica-Privacy-Policy

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

Vindica ("the App") is a screen time management application developed by William Austin. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.

**The short version: Vindica does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. Everything stays on your device.**

---

## What Data the App Uses

Vindica uses Apple's Screen Time and Family Controls frameworks to monitor and restrict app usage on your device. This includes:

- **App usage data** — which apps you use and for how long, used solely to enforce the blocking rules you configure
- **Location data** — your device location, used solely to activate location-based blocks you define (e.g. "block social media when at work")
- **Your blocking configuration** — the apps, time limits, and schedules you set up in the app

---

## How Data Is Stored

All data is stored **locally on your device only**, inside a secure container accessible only to Vindica and its system extensions.

- No data is sent to any server
- No data is stored in the cloud
- No data is shared with third parties
- No analytics or crash reporting services are used

---

## Apple Frameworks Used

Vindica uses the following Apple system frameworks:

- **Family Controls** — to request permission to monitor and restrict app usage
- **DeviceActivity** — to monitor app usage in the background
- **ManagedSettings** — to apply app restrictions (shields)
- **CoreLocation** — to detect when you enter or leave locations you define

These frameworks operate entirely on-device. Apple's own privacy policies govern how these frameworks function at the OS level.

---

## Location Data

Vindica requests "Always On" location permission so that location-based blocks can activate even when the app is in the background. Your location is:

- Never recorded or logged
- Never transmitted off your device
- Only used in real-time to check if you are inside a region you defined

You can revoke location permission at any time in iOS Settings → Vindica → Location.

---

## Children's Privacy

Vindica is designed to be used by individuals managing their own screen time. The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you are a parent setting up Vindica for a child, all data remains on the device and is not accessible to us.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
